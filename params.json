{"name":"On working with The Virtual Brain ","tagline":"and some non virtual thoughts about Google Summer of Code 2014.","body":"### What is this about? \r\n\r\nHi all, my name is Robert Parcus and I'm a CS student\r\nfrom UNIPG (Italy). I'm moving to Hong Kong this September to further my studies\r\nand my plan for the Summer of 2014 was to participate in this year's [Google\r\nSummer Of Code](https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2014).\r\n\r\nGladly, I was accepted as a student in this amazing project and here I would\r\nlike to spend a few words about the whole experience. Going from the application\r\nphase up to the finishing days. I hope you will enjoy the journey as much as I did.\r\n\r\n### The Application Phase:\r\nAfter browsing the list of accepted organizations, I quick\r\n\r\n### Volumetric Time series visualizer for TVB and updating other visualization tools\r\n\r\nThis was the final title of my proposal. From the Google-melange website:\r\n>**Organization:** International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility\r\n\r\n>**Assigned mentors:** Lia Domide, Paula Sanz-Leon\r\n\r\n>**Short description:** The main goal of this proposal is to implement a time-\r\nseries visualizer for 4D data in TVB, which would enable users to work with\r\ntheir functional MRI data directly from the browser. Then I will work on\r\nrewriting some of the visualizers that are currently implemented using\r\nMatplotLib and MPLH5, backed with web-friendly tools.\r\n\r\nThe proposal itself was much bigger and specific than this. The whole application\r\nphase was already a big challenge by itself. It was my first time planning for \r\na project this big and I learned a lot during the process. A big help came from\r\nmy mentors who always had good suggestions ready for me and I can't stress enough\r\nhow much a good advice from your mentor can help you in a tricky situation.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
